	Note:
		
			It is important an Assessor is ‘Assigned’ to a proposal ASAP. 
			To determine who is responsible for assessing a proposal consult your local Assessor’s ‘Regional Ready Reckoner’ or discuss with the district or regional manager. 
			DBCAs aim is to have proposals assessed and an approval decision made within 30-working days (from lodgment) unless significant amendments  are required.  
			See {{ proposal_assess_help_page }} for full instructions.
